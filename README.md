Requirements
--------------
For the linearization approximations, the program is written in Matlab 2014b. 

For the sampling approximations, the program is written in Python 2.7 and makes use of NumPy 1.7.1, SciPy 0.12.0, Matplotlib 1.2.1, Pandas. Please have these packages installed, on Ubuntu they can be installed using "sudo pip install --upgrade *package-name* ".
